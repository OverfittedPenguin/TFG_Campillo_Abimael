\chapter{Justification}

Approach and explanation of the need to carry out the project from a global vision, i.e. detailing why this project may be necessary.


Furthermore, in case the thesis is based on another project or is developed within the framework of a company or research group, the section must also include a brief explanation about the context of the work, that is, about possible related projects and thesis that have been done before, focusing and contextualizing the work.

Although this section begins with a global vision, it must approach a more specific vision, detailing the possible advantages and disadvantages that the student's approach may have.
