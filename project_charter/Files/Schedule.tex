\chapter{Schedule}

Brief description of the tasks and packages of tasks to be performed in order to achieve the objective of the project or study, estimating the time required for the completion of each one of them.

Furthermore, in addition to describing the task packages, it is necessary to identify the dependencies between them and how they are related. 

Therefore, for this section to be well done, it will be necessary to add at the end the thesis schedule with the tasks, either in Gantt chart format or equivalent.
