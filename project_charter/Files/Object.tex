\chapter{Object}

The main objective of this thesis is to develop an algorithm capable of computing the optimal flight trajectory for a \gls{uav} operating in firefighting missions. The algorithm is designed to generate restricted trajectories within a vertical plane while considering multiple environmental and operational constraints, such as the \gls{dem}, pre-defined \gls{nfz}, detected obstacles, and wind conditions.

Specifically, the algorithm aims to determine the descent path during the water-drop manoeuvre and the subsequent ascent trajectory, ensuring obstacle avoidance and compliance with mission constraints. Furthermore, it is intended to achieve a computational efficiency that enables real-time execution, making it suitable for on-board integration within the aircraft’s guidance system.

This thesis is developed  in collaboration of Singular Aircraft S.L. as part of a extracurricular internship agreement along with other tasks.
