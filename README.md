# Real-Time Optimal Trajectory Generation for Fixed-Wing UAVs in Firefighting Missions via Numerical Integration and Constrained Optimization
This repository includes all the files of my final bachelor's degree thesis. This thesis is about optimal control in real-time embedded applications for low-speed water drop manoeuvres in firefighting fixed-wing UAVs. It was fully developed during the internship at Singular Aircraft, and it was designed for Flyox autonomous firefighting manoeuvres. This bachelor's degree thesis has been developed to fulfill the Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Technology Engineering offered by the Escola d'Enginyeria Industrial, Aeroespacial i Audiovisual de Terrassa (ESEIAAT), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).

Included in the repository are two different folders: report and code. Inside the report folder, the user can find the latest version of the bachelor's thesis report in PDF format, along with all the different LaTeX files. In the code folder, there is a main code file programmed in Python, as well as other source code files inside a folder.
