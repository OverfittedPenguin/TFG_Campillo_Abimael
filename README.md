This repository includes all the files of my final bachelor's degree thesis. This thesis is about optimal control in real-time embedded applications for low-speed water drop manoeuvres in firefighting fixed-wing UAVs. It was fully developed during the internship at Singular Aircraft, and it was designed for Flyox autonomous firefighting manoeuvres. This bachelor's degree thesis has been developed to fulfill the Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Technologies offered by the Escola d'Enginyeria Industrial, Aeroespacial i Audiovisual de Terrassa (ESEIAAT), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC).

Included in the repository are two different folders: report and code. Inside the report folder, the user can find the latest version of the bachelor thesis report in PDF format, along with the source folder (src), which contains all the different LaTeX files. In the code folder, there is a main code file programmed in MATLAB, as well as other source code files inside a folder. 

*July 2025* - Project's kick off.
*August 2025* - Research and familiarisation with the mathematical formulation of the Optimal Control problem.
*September 2025* - First wording of the thesis project and start of the src code.
