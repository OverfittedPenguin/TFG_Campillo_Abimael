This repository includes all the files of my final bachelor's degree thesis. This thesis is about optimal control in real-time embedded applications for low-speed water drop manoeuvres in firefighting fixed-wing UAVs. It was fully developed during the internship at Singular Aircraft and it was developed for Flyox autonomous firefighting manoeuvres.
