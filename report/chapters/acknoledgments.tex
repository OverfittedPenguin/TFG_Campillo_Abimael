Firstly, I would like to thank my bachelor's degree thesis director, Alex Ferre, for his guidance, patience and dedication through all this project development. I would also thank him for introducing me such a passionate world as flight trajectory optimisation.

In second place, I would like to show gratitude to Singular Aircraft and all its participants for the opportunity to work on a project of this magnitude and to be able to contribute to creating a better world. Specially, I would to appreciate to Miguel Pareja for his invaluable comments and observations, as well as all the lessons and experiences I have had. To Pol Padilla, I would also thank his observations and deep knowledge in the matter. Guys, this is only the beginning.

A mis amigos, me gustaría agradaecerles su apoyo incondicional todos estos años, así como todos los momentos de alegría, las risas, las vivencias y todas las experiencias que hemos compartido. A mi familia, y en especial a ti mamá, gracias por estar siempre ahí y tener paciencia mientras cumplía uno de mis sueños. Os quiero.
